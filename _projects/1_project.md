<!-- I curate and release large-scale, high-quality datasets and corpora to support open science in AI research. -->

With [Lucy Wang](https://llwang.net/), I produced:
* [CORD-19](https://aclanthology.org/2020.nlpcovid19-acl.1/), the most comprehensive, continually-updated set of COVID-19 literature at the time, and
* [S2ORC](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.447), the largest, machine-readable collection of open-access full-text papers to-date. Request API access ðŸ”‘ [here](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api)!

Today, I am co-leading the data effort for [OLMo](https://allenai.org/olmo) with [Luca Soldaini](https://soldaini.net/). We've released:
* [peS2o](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/peS2o), a transformation of S2ORC optimized for pretraining language models of science,
* [Dolma](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/dolma), the largest open dataset for language model pretraining to-date.

<!-- In 2024, I'll be working on large-scale, multimodal datasets! -->
