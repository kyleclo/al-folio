I'm a founding member and a lead contributor to the [Semantic Reader](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14334) project, which combines HCI and AI research to design intelligent reading interfaces for scientists. I am also an active developer of the [Semantic Reader Open Research Platform](https://openreader.semanticscholar.org/), where we share all our code, models and data publicly so others can build their own reading interfaces.

Through this project, I've developed novel systems including [ScholarPhi](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445648) which explains math notation, [Scim](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3581641.3584034) which highlights salient passages, and [PaperPlain](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3589955) which simplifies difficult passages and provides navigational guidance. One such system called [CiteSee](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3580847), which visually augments and personalizes inline citations while reading, won a best paper award at CHI 2023 üèÜ.
