I design rigorous evaluation guidelines for NLP, including [few-shot learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=_WnGcwXLYOE) and [long-form summarization](https://aclanthology.org/2023.eacl-main.121/) which won an outstanding paper award at EACL 2023 üèÜ.

I've organized community shared tasks to evaluate NLP systems for biomedical literature retrieval and understanding, including [TREC-COVID](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239098/) and [SCIVER](https://aclanthology.org/2021.sdp-1.16/). 

I've also worked on standardized benchmark development for [domain fit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10523) and [efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09701) of language models.
