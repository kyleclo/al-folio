I've identified key limitations in today's language models:

* Language models produce worse multidocument summaries when provided retrieved documents [(EMNLP Findings 2023)](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.549/),
* Standard prompting strategies result in coherence errors when summarizing novels [(arXiv 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00785),
* Layout-infused language models can be worse than text-only language models at visual layout parsing [(ACL Findings 2023)](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.844/), 
* Language models can decontextualize snippets from Wikipedia but not scientific articles [(EMNLP 2023)](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.193/).
