I've published some of the largest gold standard datasets for training and evaluating language models on scientific literature understanding tasks, including:

* [SciTLDR](https://aclanthology.org/2020.findings-emnlp.428/) for summarization, 
* [SciFact](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.609/) for claim verification, 
* [Qasper](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.365/) for question answering, 
* [MultiCite](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.137/) for citation discourse understanding.

Recently I've been interested in helping humans re-find documents they've seen before, even when they [don't remember identifying details](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.367/).
