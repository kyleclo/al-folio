abstract = {TREC-COVID is a community evaluation designed to build a test collection that captures the information needs of biomedical researchers using the scientific literature during a pandemic. One of the key characteristics of pandemic search is the accelerated rate of change: the topics of interest evolve as the pandemic progresses and the scientific literature in the area explodes. The COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to capture this progression as it happens. TREC-COVID, in creating a test collection around COVID-19 literature, is building infrastructure to support new research and technologies in pandemic search.},

    abstract = "The COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) is a growing resource of scientific papers on COVID-19 and related historical coronavirus research. CORD-19 is designed to facilitate the development of text mining and information retrieval systems over its rich collection of metadata and structured full text papers. Since its release, CORD-19 has been downloaded over 200K times and has served as the basis of many COVID-19 text mining and discovery systems. In this article, we describe the mechanics of dataset construction, highlighting challenges and key design decisions, provide an overview of how CORD-19 has been used, and describe several shared tasks built around the dataset. We hope this resource will continue to bring together the computing community, biomedical experts, and policy makers in the search for effective treatments and management policies for COVID-19.",
