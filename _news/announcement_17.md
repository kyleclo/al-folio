[Molmo](https://molmo.allenai.org) our first multimodal OLMo model is out! Molmo is our family of open, late-fusion image+text language models, all available on huggingface, trained using a really high-quality dataset of images + dense captions / task demonstrations that we'll be releasing openly! Read the paper [here](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2409.17146), play with the model [here](https://molmo.allenai.org), and download the weights [here](https://huggingface.co/collections/allenai/molmo-66f379e6fe3b8ef090a8ca19).
