Interested in working with me? Apply to join our team as a [**Research Intern**](#research-internship) or [**Predoctoral Researcher**](#predoctoral-research)!


As an intern or predoctoral researcher, you'll work directly with me and other full-time researchers on a research project tailored to your interests. We aim for high-impact research publications at top-tier computer science venues, and we make all project artifacts open and publicly accessible, including code, models and data.

See [**FAQs**](#faqs) for more info about working with me.

### FAQs

For interns:

* **Who?** 
  * **Eligibility?** 
    * ‚úÖ Current students,
    * ‚úÖ Incoming students to a PhD program,
    * ‚ùå Non-students,
    * ‚úÖ Domestic and international applicants welcome.
  * **Experience?** 
    * Most interns are PhD students, but we've also hired exceptional Master's and undergraduate students,
    * I tend to hire students with aligned interests as me and a track record of research contributions, whether that's writing papers (published or preprints) or open-source contributions. Your total publication count or university affiliation doesn't matter; I look more for a good collaboration fit and quality of work. 
* **When?** All research internships are paid, full-time positions for 3-6 months. Start times are flexible, though I typically recommend May or June for summer internships as there is usually a large, fun cohort at the office. 
* **Where?** Internships are typically in-person at the AI2 office in Seattle, though I've also hired remote interns before. 
* **How?** Apply at the link above and mention my name in your application. I recommend taking a look at my recent publications to get a sense of what type of projects I'm interested in.

For predocs:

* **Who?** 
  * **Eligibility?** This is a great position for:
    * ‚úÖ Any prospective PhD applicant, including current students near graduation and former students already working,
    * ‚úÖ Anyone already been accepted to a PhD program and looking to defer enrollment for a year,
    * ‚ùå Already enrolled in a PhD program,
    * ‚úÖ Domestic and international applicants welcome.
  * **Experience?**
    * Some research experience required. You don't need many papers, nor do they have to be published (preprints are OK).
    * Strong coding skills preferred. Especially if you can point to contributions to open-source projects or demonstrations of your work. You don't need industry software development experience.
* **When?** All predoctoral research positions are paid, full-time positions for 1-3 years. Start times are flexible. Contracts must be renewed each year. 
* **Where?** All predoctoral research positions must be in-person at the AI2 office in Seattle at least part of the week.
* **How?** Apply at the link above and mention my name in your application. I recommend taking a look at my recent publications to get a sense of what type of projects I'm interested in.
