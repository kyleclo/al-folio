I'm a research scientist at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/) on the [OLMo](https://allenai.org/olmo) and [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/research/research-team) projects.
<!-- for scientific research assistance  -->
I specialize in topics in natural language processing, machine learning and human-AI interaction:
* [Open Data for Language Models](/projects/1_project)
* [Adapting Language Models to Specialized Texts](/projects/2_project)
* [Standards and Best Practices in NLP Evaluation](/projects/3_project)
* [NLP for Sensemaking over Large Collections](/projects/4_project)
* [AI-Powered Reading Assistance](/projects/5_project)
<!-- * [Limitations in Language Models](/projects/6_project) -->

<!-- Reading long, technical documents is hard, even for experienced scholars. How can AI assistance help? -->
 <!-- we make them more accessible by automatically transforming papers into dynamic web documents with helpful interactive features?  -->





<!-- I've also worked as a statistician / data scientist in Seattle and an applied probability researcher at [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en) in Taiwan.  I graduated in 2015 with an MS in [Statistics from the University of Washington](https://www.stat.washington.edu/). -->

<!--  Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
