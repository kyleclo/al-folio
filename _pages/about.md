Scientist at [Semantic Scholar Research](https://www.semanticscholar.org/research/research-team), [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/) helping scientists do research. My work:


##### ▸ Language models beyond web text

Are language models trained on broad web crawls useful when applied to other texts, like scientific articles or legal documents?  

I study how to control, adapt, and evaluate language models in out-of-domain, limited data settings. See my work in [pretraining](https://aclanthology.org/D19-1371), [domain adaptation](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.740/) and [few-shot learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=_WnGcwXLYOE). 



##### ▸ NLP over document collections

I develop NLP systems that help humans identify, organize, and summarize useful information in large document collections, such as [question-answering](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.365/) over papers, [fact-checking](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.609/) claims against literature, and summarizing [papers](https://aclanthology.org/2020.findings-emnlp.428) or [legal cases](https://openreview.net/forum?id=z1d8fUiS8Cr).


##### ▸ Intelligent reading interfaces

<!-- Reading papers is hard, even for experienced researchers. Can we make them more accessible by automatically transforming papers into dynamic web documents with helpful interactive features? --> 

I design [intelligent reading interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14334) that make papers more accessible, such as by [explaining math notation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445648) and [highlighting salient passages](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3581641.3584034). For non-expert readers, I build tools that [simplify difficult passages and provide navigational guidance](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3589955).


##### ▸ Resources for open science

I curate and release large-scale, high-quality datasets and corpora to support areas of research I care about. Examples include [S2ORC](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.447), the largest, machine-readable collection of open-access full-text papers to-date and [CORD-19](https://aclanthology.org/2020.nlpcovid19-acl.1/), a specialized set of COVID-19 literature.


<!-- I've also worked as a statistician / data scientist in Seattle and an applied probability researcher at [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en) in Taiwan.  I graduated in 2015 with an MS in [Statistics from the University of Washington](https://www.stat.washington.edu/). -->

<!--  Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
